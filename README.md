## Planning, Process & Problem-Solving




### User Stories
- As a car owner, I would like to enter my current mileage so that I can use this as a baseline for the frequency of other events.
- As a car owner, I would like to enter the number of gallons of gas each time I fill up so that I can track miles driven between each fill up.
- As a car owner, I would like to enter the total spent on gas each time I fill up so that I can track how much I spend on gas.

* Reach User Stories:
* As a car owner, I would like to view MPG between fill ups so that I can monitor my car’s performance.
* As a fiscally responsible car owner, I would like to view the total amount I’ve spent on gas this year so that I can fit it into my budget.
